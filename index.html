        Hi, I'm Ethan. I'm a software engineer, currently at bioMÃ©rieux in Salt Lake City building
        applications for the production and testing of in-vitro diagnostic medical
        devices. Prior to this, I worked on e-commerce sites for small businesses and on CRM software. I continue to look
        for new learning opportunities.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the spring of 2023 I graduated from the University of Utah with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 
        <br />
        <br />
        I also really enjoy running, and I hope to write about that and any other stray thoughts here in the future.
