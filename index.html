            I'm currently a software developer at bioMerieux developing
            applications for the production and testing of in-vitro diagnostic
            medical devices. I love being on the cutting edge of new technology
            related to biology and solving the complex problems that come with
            it.

            <br />
            Prior to my current position, I worked on e-commerce sites for small
            to mid-size companies and custom CRM software. I have a Bachelors of
            Computer Science from the University of Utah, and I continue to look
            for opportunities to continue learning.
