      Hi, I'm Ethan. I'm a software engineer, currently at bioMÃ©rieux building
      applications for the production and testing of in-vitro diagnostic medical
      devices. Prior to this, I worked on e-commerce sites for small businesses and on CRM software. I continue to look
      for new learning opportunities.
      <br />
      <br />
      I also really enjoy running and road racing, and I hope to write about that and any other stray thoughts here.
